zoxide is a **smarter cd command**, inspired by z and autojump.

It remembers which directories you use most frequently, so you can "jump" to
them in just a few keystrokes.<br />
zoxide works on all major shells.

## Getting started

![Tutorial][tutorial]

```sh
z foo              # cd into highest ranked directory matching foo
z foo bar          # cd into highest ranked directory matching foo and bar
z foo /            # cd into a subdirectory starting with foo

z ~/foo            # z also works like a regular cd command
z foo/             # cd into relative path
z ..               # cd one level up
z -                # cd into previous directory

zi foo             # cd with interactive selection (using fzf)

z foo<SPACE><TAB>  # show interactive completions (zoxide v0.8.0+, bash 4.4+/fish/zsh only)
```
